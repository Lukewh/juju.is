And because of this communication layer, a lot of the problems that conventional configuration management systems have just donâ€™t exist anymore.</p>

So if you have a web server that's managed by Chef and a database that's deployed by a Docker container, you can have the web server talk to the database and the relations between these two very easily.</p>

Juju is available on the command line as well as with an easy to install web user interface. The ecosystem provides a large number of charms (packages defining the services and their configuration as well as runtime hooks) and can be used from testing with local LXC containers up to Amazon, OpenStack, Azure, and more.</p>
